Description of the funcionality necessary for the Geant Exascale Proxy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The proxy should be a standalone application with a mean to explore various detector
layouts, for example the CMS detector and a Liqui Argon TPC bothwith a variable
magnetic field.  It should provides interfaces to configure different
configurations of physics lists, detector descriptions (eg. GDML) and input event types.

The proxy should support the option to transport charged particle in a uniform
magnetic field, and in a realistic magnetic field description used in typical
HEP experiments.

The proxy should handle a standard set of electromagnetic physics processes and
models required for most of HEP detector simulation including ionization,
bremsstrahlung, multiple scattering models for electron and positron, and
photoelectric, Compton scattering and pair-production models for photons.

For event input, the proxy should supports the option to use a the particle gun with
various customization (number of particles, particle types, random distributions
of energy, eta, phi in given ranges); the ability to also use HEPevents
(for an example, BSM events from PYTHIA) would be a plus.

The proxy should also provide an output representative a typical HEP experiment,
for example the response for a (sub-set) of sensitive detector.

The proxy should also produce output data representative a typical HEP experiment,
for example digitized hits (scoring) in sensitive detectors.

The proxy should includes (directly or indirectly) the ability to measure
scalabily, event throughput and memory usage under various configuration
setting including multi-threaded execution.
