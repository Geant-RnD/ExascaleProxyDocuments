# Geant Exascale Proxy Documents

Collection of document describing and related to the Geant Exascale Proxy developed
by a partnership between ECP and Computational HEP (CompHEP).

In order to support the efforts toward exascale readiness for Geant (toolkit for the simulation of interactions of particles traveling through matter), the Geant Exascale Proxy project is aiming to develop a Geant proxy application in the context of the ECP co-design focus area and use it to study and characterize architecture and performance.  The application will be stand-alone, free of external dependencies, and will encapsulate a minimum set of physics and software framework processes necessary to describe a HEP simulation problem.   The proxy will then be used to exercise communication, computation and data access patterns.  The projectâ€™s main objective is to identify re-engineering opportunities that will increase event throughput by improving single node performance and being able to make efficient use of of the next generation of  accelerators available in exascale facilities.
